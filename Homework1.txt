Problem 2:

a) 00001010
b) 0110110100
c) 010000000000
d) 11110011
e) 10000000001
f) 110000000000



Problem 3:

n f(n)
1 4
2 16
3 256
4 65536
5 4294967296
6 18446744073709551616

a) n=2: since the 8 bit range is -127 to 128, and n=2 is 16 while n=3 is 256
b) n=3: the largest positive 16 bit int is above 30000, so the long int can
hold 256 but not 65536
c) n=3: the largest positive unsigned 16 bit int is 66535, so the unsigned long
int can also only go up to n=3
